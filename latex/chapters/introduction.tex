\section{Background of the Study}
 As the ocean covers over 70\% of the Earth's surface, presenting a vast and complex environment ripe for exploration and study. 
            Sea surface drones offer a valuable tool for navigating water bodies, collecting data, and conducting research across various disciplines. 
            Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities have become pivotal in various applications, particularly 
            in water environments.

 Early USVs were also called ASC; Autonomous Surface Craft (ASCs) which were first developed at the MIT Sea Grant College Program in 1993 and 
            were designed for various missions. Aptly named ARTEMIS,the vessel was a scale replica of a fishing trawler used as a platform capable of 
            testing the navigation and control systems required by an ASC. Later on a new ASC ACES(Autonomous Coastal Exploration System) was developed 
            during 1996 and 1997(Justin E. Manley 2008)

 Further adaptation of USV in the early 20th century saw the development of remotely controlled USVs used for mine detection and target 
            practice. World War II further spurred advancements, with nations utilizing USVs for reconnaissance and explosive delivery. Post-war, 
            oceanographic research embraced USVs for data collection and underwater exploration. Notably, the bathyscaphe Trieste, equipped with a 
            rudimentary autopilot, famously reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans in 1960( National Museum of the U.S. Navy)
          
 The 1990s witnessed a surge in commercial applications, with USVs employed for offshore oil and gas exploration, pipeline inspections, and 
            aquaculture monitoring. The 21st century has seen a continued proliferation of USVs, with advancements in sensor technology, autonomous 
            navigation systems, and communication capabilities propelling their capabilities further.

 However, while traditional methods for marine data collection involve time-consuming, expensive, and potentially risky manual operations,
            unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) offer a compelling alternative. These vehicles promise efficient, cost-effective, and safe data collection 
            across vast areas. However, current USV technology faces three key hurdles: high cost due to complex hardware and software, limited 
            accessibility due to user interfaces and maintenance requirements, and navigation challenges in dynamic aquatic environments. This study aims 
            to address these limitations by developing a modular unmanned surface drone with a focus on simplified maintenance, affordability, and 
            interchangeable components that can be easily switched.

 Empirical testing conducted as part of this research, quantifying the water surface drone's ability to reach predefined target positions, 
            serves as a critical quantitative assessment of the system's accuracy. The results obtained will offer data ensuring the navigational 
            reliability of the drone.

 The drones modular design enables adaptation on sea applications based on specific needs, seamlessly integrating communication modules, 
            lifesaving equipment, or various sensors as required. This adaptability ensures tailored responses to emergency situations and varied data 
            collection demands. 


\section{Statement of the Problem}
 How accurate is the Modular Self-Navigating unmanned surface drone when moving from point of origin to the user inputted coordinates?

\section{Hypothesis}
 Drone accuracy will be high and can effectively navigate to the user supplied coordinates.

\section{Theoratical Framework}
From a control systems perspective, the drone leverages feedback mechanisms and advanced algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation and 
mission execution. This dictates the drone's ability to gather environmental data, make real-time decisions, and dynamically adjust its 
actions based on sensor readings and mission parameters. Furthermore, the modular design aligns with the principles of modular robotics, 
emphasizing the benefits of independent, interchangeable components. This enables tailored configurations for diverse tasks, offering 
adaptability to various environments and operational needs. Additionally, the drone can be understood through the distributed systems theory, 
which emphasizes the coordination of multiple agents towards a common goal. In this context, the modular components act as individual agents 
collaborating to make the sea surface drone function. This theory guides the design of communication protocols and inter-module coordination 
algorithms, essential for seamless collaboration and collective task execution. By integrating these theories, drone development can benefit 
from established principles in control, modularity, and distributed systems, leading to a robust, adaptable, and efficient platform for maritime 
operations.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ConceptualFramework} shows the conceptual framework on how the drone functions. To discuss briefly; user provides geographical
coordinates or destination data to the ESP-32 onboard the sea surface drone. Magnetometer and GPS sensors collect real-time data regarding the 
drone's current position, orientation, and the magnetic field. The ESP-32 employs a navigation algorithm that processes user input and sensor 
data from gps and magnetometer.

Continuous feedback loop adjusts the drone's path in real-time based on the latest sensor data, ensuring adaptability to various sea disturbances.

\section{Objectives}

General Objectives: \\

\section{Significance of the Study}
Developing a modular water surface drone equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities holds significant value. The widespread adoption of
such drones requires accessible construction and upkeep, making them viable tools for various users. Evaluating the drone's accuracy in reaching
target positions offers crucial empirical data, validating its reliability and paving the way for more practical applications. This project 
contributes to the progress of sea surface drone technology, potentially impacting research initiatives in oceanography, environmental monitoring, 
and more. Furthermore, being easy to reproduce fosters broader use, democratizing access to this technology.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Study}
The research concentrates on assessing the accuracy of the drone's navigation, particularly in reaching user-provided coordinates, with a focus
on real-time adjustments and adaptability to various water disturbances.  The drone is limited to a navigation algorithm that checks and corrects
for its navigational pathing on loop. Said algorithm is only designed for relatively small distances as it doesn't take into account the curvature 
of the earth and the distance measured by the algorithm is assuming a straight line and not a part of the Great Circle.

The study does not consider the potential challenges posed by capsizing due to strong tidal waves or encountering large obstructing objects
in the ocean. Furthermore, the research does not extensively explore the intricate legal and regulatory frameworks governing unmanned surface 
drones, instead prioritizing an in-depth examination of the technical aspects related to navigation.

While the study’s primary focus is on navigation accuracy, the drone is inherently modular(Figure \ref{fig:3dModelComplete}). This modular 
design enables the replacement of various components to meet the specific requirements of future users, enhancing its versatility and 
adaptability in different scenarios.
