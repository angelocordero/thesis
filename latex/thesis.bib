abstract = {This article presents navigation, guidance and control (NGC) experimental results obtained on an innovative overactuated unmanned surface marine vessel (USV) capable of omnidirectional motion. The results were obtained during sea trials in real environmental conditions where external disturbances and sensor characteristics have significant influence on the vehicle behavior. While performing the NGC experiments, the following set of behaviors is demonstrated: (1) successful heading control even in cases when the USV is performing simultaneous omnidirectional motion; (2) dynamic positioning algorithm performance with the navigation filter that uses only GPS measurement and a simple uncoupled dynamic model of an overactuated USV; (3) two line following algorithms (one using full actuation capabilities, and the other emulating underactuated line following) and comparing them by using quality metrics; and (4) online modification of mission parameters within the mission control architecture that is based on three layers (primitives, high-level and low-level control). Finally, we use results from multiple days of experiments to show how GPS update frequency influences (i) the quality of DP performance and (ii) the quality of the commanded control signal.}

abstract = {While IMO's e-Navigation project's scope is to enhance safety of navigation by improved ship-to-shore-cooperation, the EU's FP7 project MUNIN's aim is to develop a concept for an autonomous dry bulk carrier, that is at least as safe as a manned vessel. As e-Navigation has a strong focus on improving the human element in shipping and MUNIN tends towards an unmanned bridge, a common baseline might look quite contradictory at first, but they share the need to ensure and enhance the safety of navigation. After an introduction into e-Navigation and the MUNIN project, this paper will demonstrate with two examples, how MUNIN's results address identified e-Navigation's gaps and addresses e-Navigation's user needs. Thus, MUNIN contributes to the development and implementation of the prioritized e-Navigation solutions.}

title = {Research on a course control strategy for unmanned surface vessel},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {With the development of intelligent control and modern communication technology, Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) will soon become another important unmanned platform after drones and unmanned vehicles. Unmanned vessel are easily disturbed by wind, waves and currents during navigation. Solving the problem of unmanned vessel’s course keeping control during navigation has become one of the key technologies in the research of unmanned vessel. Aiming at the course control problem of the unmanned vessel in the course of navigation, this paper firstly carried out mathematical modeling and data analysis on the dynamic model of the experimental unmanned vessel, carried out related design simulations and experiments through the constructed model, and propose an optimal control strategy based on PID controller. On this basis, the accuracy and effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in this paper are verified through a simulation platform, which can ensure the course stability of the unmanned vessel during the navigation process. Key technologies such as UAV obstacle avoidance and coordination provide a theoretical basis.}
